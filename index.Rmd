## Introduction to the shiny app

1. The app is built using shiny and hosted on shinyapps.io.
2. The app calculates probability of a score according to standard normal density.

## Math behind

1. A standard normal distributed variable is of form $X\sim N(0,1)$
2. The PDF is $f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}$
3. A upper tail probability for a score x is calculated using $P(X>x)$ 
4. A lower tail probability for a score x is calculated using $1-P(X>x)$

## R code

1. The probability is calculated using R function pnorm()
```{r}
x = 0.5
lower = T
pnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = lower)
```
2. The value for x and wether user wants a lower probability or a upper probability are based on user input.
